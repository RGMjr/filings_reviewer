## 9. Snap Filing (ID 32/33) — Mislabeled Data (Validation DB Dependency Resolved)

**Status**: Partially resolved — validation DB dependency eliminated; Snap CIK fix still pending
**Severity**: Low (Snap not yet in gold standard; gold standard validation no longer DB-dependent)
**Discovered**: 2025-12-27 (HRV-5)
**Investigated**: 2026-03-19
**Updated**: 2026-03-19

### Problem

Filing ID 33 (and later reorganized to ID 32 in `gi3_richness_analysis.py`) is labeled "Snap"
but the CIK on record (`0001644378`) belongs to **RMR Group Inc.** (a REIT management company),
confirmed via SEC EDGAR API.

The local dev DB validation dataset was found to be **empty** as of 2026-03-19. The backup file
`filings_backup.dump` contains only schema, not data.

### Confirmed Facts

- Filing 33 CIK `0001644378` = RMR Group Inc. (confirmed 2026-03-19 via SEC API)
- Snap's correct CIK = `0001564408`, form S-1/A, filed 2017-02-27, accession `0001193125-17-056992`
- `gi3_richness_analysis.py` FILING_MAP comment was stale (said "IDs 31/33" were wrong; actually
  IDs 32/34 had RLX Technology / Vodka Brands data per GR-FINAL_VALIDATION.md 2025-12-26)

### Root Cause

CIK `0001644378` was mistakenly used for Snap instead of `0001564408` when originally ingested.

### Resolution (2026-03-19)

The empty local validation DB is no longer a blocker. Gold standard validation now runs in
**fresh mode** (`pytest -m gold_standard --gold-standard-mode=fresh -v`), which re-extracts
candidates directly from locally cached HTML files without requiring a populated database.

`test_gold_standard_regression.py` now supports `--gold-standard-mode=fresh`, making the
validation reproducible without any database setup. The `*.dump` pattern is now in `.gitignore`
to prevent accidentally committing production database dumps.

### Remaining (Low Priority)

- Upsert Snap with correct CIK `0001564408` and add to gold standard (separate task, not blocking)

### Partial Fix Applied (2026-03-19)

- Corrected stale comment in `gi3_richness_analysis.py` FILING_MAP
- Added inline note on Snap CIK pending fix

## 11. Gold Standard Coverage Tests — Partially Resolved

**Status**: Partially resolved
**Severity**: Low (1 test remaining)
**Discovered**: 2026-03-19
**Updated**: 2026-03-31

### Original Problem

Two tests in `tests/integration/test_gold_standard_coverage.py` were failing:
- `test_candidate_generation_finds_active_consumers`
- `test_candidate_generation_finds_number_of_orders`

### Resolution (2026-03-31)

Diagnosed and fixed. The failures had two root causes unrelated to the Farfetch re-fetch:

1. **Wrong metric ID** — Test expected `cm_transactions_by_cohort` for "Number of Orders", but extraction
   maps this to `cm_purchase_transactions_overall`. Fixed in test assertions (lines 62, 67, 267).

2. **Broken import in `TestKeywordPatterns`** — Tests accessed `MetricClassifier.METRIC_KEYWORDS` which
   does not exist (only `GENERAL_METRIC_KEYWORDS` is on the class). Fixed to import
   `METRIC_KEYWORDS` from `src.review.keyword_matching`.

After fix: 11/12 tests in `test_gold_standard_coverage.py` pass.

### Remaining (Issue #10)

`test_candidate_generation_finds_active_consumers` still fails due to CMS-1 cross-metric suppression.
The "Active Consumers" keyword matches both `cm_active_customers_total` and `cm_customers_period_end`;
the CMS-1 tie-breaker assigns it to `cm_customers_period_end`. The gold standard expects
`cm_active_customers_total`. Resolving this requires an extraction logic decision — see Issue #10 below.

## 2. Low Farfetch Recall (12.5%)

**Status**: Partially Diagnosed
**Severity**: Medium
**Discovered**: 2026-01-01

### Problem

Only 1 of 8 non-chart Farfetch gold standard values matched during validation.

### Contributing Factors

1. ~~**Metric ID mismatch** (see Issue #1)~~ — resolved; gold standard IDs now aligned
2. ~~**URL issue**: `sec_html_url` for Farfetch resolves to a directory index (see Issue #6)~~ — resolved; re-fetch 78 cloud-stored filings on Render
3. **Value normalization differences**: Gold uses exact values, system may normalize differently
4. **Missing patterns**: Some keywords may not trigger candidate generation

### CAC Payback Period (FIXED)

The CAC payback period value "six" (months) was not being extracted:
- Pattern `\bpayback\s+period\s+(?:on|for)\s+cac\b` added to catch this variant
- Spelled-out number support added to handle "six"
- Now correctly generates candidate for `cm_cac_payback_period: six`

### Remaining Gaps

- Re-evaluate Farfetch recall after cloud re-fetch of 78 filings is complete (Issue #6 fix applied; re-fetch pending on Render)
- Review Active Consumers, Number of Orders, Take Rate patterns once document fetch is working
- Active Consumers misassignment is also tracked under Issue #10 (CMS-1 suppression)

---

## 4. Spelled-Out Number Parsing Limitations

**Status**: Known Limitation
**Severity**: Low (edge case)

### Current Support

The system correctly parses:
- Simple numbers: "six", "twenty", "ninety"
- Teen numbers: "eleven", "fifteen", "nineteen"
- Compound numbers: "twenty-one", "forty-five"
- Magnitude words: "five million", "two billion"
- Hundreds: "hundred", "one hundred", "two hundred"

### Not Supported

Complex numbers like:
- "one hundred twenty-three" (compound hundreds)
- "two thousand five hundred" (multi-magnitude)
- "four hundred and fifty" (with "and")

### Rationale

These complex spelled-out numbers are rare in SEC filings - companies typically use numeric format for precision. The current implementation handles the common cases (e.g., "six months" for CAC payback period).

## 5. Revenue Synonym Context Gating

**Status**: Working as Designed
**Severity**: N/A (architectural decision)

### Background

Revenue-related metrics (GMV, TCV, ACV, Bookings, Billings) only generate review candidates when cohort/per-customer context is present. This is intentional to reduce false positives.

### Current Behavior

- ARR/MRR: Always generate candidates (inherently customer-related)
- GMV/TCV/ACV/Bookings/Billings: Require context keywords within 1500 chars
- Context keywords: cohort, vintage, per customer, per user, by account, etc.

### Potential Issue

Some valid per-customer GMV values may not have context keywords nearby, causing them to be missed.

### Monitoring

Review rejection rates for revenue synonyms to determine if context gating is too strict.

## 13. V2 Metric Facts Identity Index Drift

**Status**: Open (documented 2026-04-18 during data-model.md rewrite; not yet fixed)
**Severity**: Low (application-layer dedup in `MetricFact.identity_tuple()` still distinguishes `source_type`; no observed duplicate-row incidents)
**Discovered**: 2026-04-18

### Problem

`sql/23_chart_source_dedup.sql` drops and recreates `idx_v2_metric_facts_identity_unique` as a 9-column partial UNIQUE index including `source_type`. The live database index has only 8 columns (no `source_type`). `MetricFact.identity_tuple()` in `src/extraction_v2/models.py` returns a 9-tuple with `source_type` at position 9.

`23_chart_source_dedup.sql` is recorded in `schema_migrations`, so the migration ran at least once — but the live DDL does not reflect the 9-column shape.

### Verified evidence (2026-04-18)

```bash
source .env && psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c \
  "SELECT indexdef FROM pg_indexes WHERE indexname='idx_v2_metric_facts_identity_unique'"
# Returns: CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ... (doc_id, canonical_metric_id,
#   COALESCE(period_start,'1900-01-01'), COALESCE(period_end,'1900-01-01'),
#   unit, scope, COALESCE(cohort_def,''), COALESCE(customer_type,''))
# — 8 columns, source_type absent.

source .env && psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c \
  "SELECT id FROM schema_migrations WHERE id='23_chart_source_dedup.sql'"
# Returns 1 row — migration is recorded as applied.
```

### Impact

- **DB layer:** a chart-sourced fact and a text-sourced fact for the same `(doc_id, metric, period, cohort, customer_type, unit, scope)` slot would be treated as conflicting rows by the 8-column index, even though the application treats them as distinct via `source_type`.
- **Application layer:** `MetricFact.identity_tuple()` includes `source_type`, so in-memory deduplication preserves CHART + TEXT/TABLE as separate facts. Persistence upserts via `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` against the 8-column index — a CHART fact may therefore overwrite a prior TEXT fact (or vice versa) on the same slot.
- **Observed incidents:** none to date.

### Next Steps

- Re-apply `sql/23_chart_source_dedup.sql` against the live DB and investigate why the previous application did not extend the index to 9 columns (possibly the migration was reverted by a subsequent schema snapshot restore).
- Alternatively: remove `source_type` from `MetricFact.identity_tuple()` and the `sql/23` file if 8-column dedup is intended.
- Coordinate with whoever owns the cross-source-confirmation work (migration 25) before changing behavior — chart-bridge facts rely on the assumption that chart and text slots are independently unique.

## 10. CMS-1 Suppression: Active Consumers Assigned to Wrong Metric

**Status**: Open
**Severity**: Low
**Discovered**: 2026-03-26

### Problem

`test_candidate_generation_finds_active_consumers` fails because value `1,118,047` ("Active Consumers") is assigned to `cm_customers_period_end` instead of `cm_active_customers_total`.

### Root Cause

Both metrics share the keyword "Active Consumers". CMS-1 cross-metric suppression (`keyword_matching.py:793`) fires when two keywords are equidistant from a number, and the longer pattern wins. `cm_customers_period_end`'s "Active Consumers" pattern wins the tie-breaker, suppressing `cm_active_customers_total`.

This also contributes to Farfetch's low recall (Issue #2) — Active Consumer values in Farfetch are systematically misassigned to `cm_customers_period_end`.

### Next Steps

- Determine whether Farfetch "Active Consumers" should map to `cm_active_customers_total` or `cm_customers_period_end` (both are plausible: active consumers = customers at period end who were active)
- If `cm_active_customers_total` is correct: adjust the CMS-1 priority so `cm_active_customers_total` wins for Farfetch's specific phrasing
- If `cm_customers_period_end` is correct: update the gold standard CSV to use `cm_customers_period_end` for Farfetch Active Consumers

## Archive (Resolved Issues)

### Issue #1: Metric ID Mismatch Between Gold Standard and System

**Status**: ✅ Resolved (2026-03-16)

Gold standard CSV (`data/gold_standard/golden_set_251218.csv`) aligned to system taxonomy in `config/metric_keywords.yaml`. No remaining ID mismatches. See git log (2026-03-16) for full resolution details.

### Issue #6: FilingFetcher Downloads Directory Index Instead of Primary Document

**Status**: ✅ Resolved (2026-03-16)

`FilingFetcher` defaulted `sec_client` to `None` and guarded URL resolution behind `if self.sec_client:`, causing directory-index pages to be saved instead of actual filings. Fixed in `src/filing_fetcher/filing_fetcher.py` (lines 81, 295). 78 cloud-fetched filings need re-fetching on Render. See git log (2026-03-16) for full details.

### Issues #7 and #8: Test Deadlock and Connection Pool Exhaustion

**Status**: ✅ Resolved (2026-03-26)

Root cause: `DatabaseAdapter` had no `close()` method; test fixtures were session-scoped with no teardown and no connection pool, so every `get_connection()` call created a new TCP connection.

Fixes applied:
- Added `DatabaseAdapter.close()` to `src/infra/db.py`
- Converted `test_db_adapter` fixtures in `tests/integration/conftest.py` and `tests/integration/extraction/conftest.py` from `return` to `yield` with pool (`max_size=5`) and teardown
- Added `command: ["postgres", "-c", "max_connections=200"]` to `docker-compose.yml`

### Issue #3: Gold Standard Methodology Questions

**Status**: ✅ Resolved (2026-03-26)

Created `docs/GOLD_STANDARD_SPECIFICATION.md` covering: metric ID alignment, value normalization rules, chart vs text classification, period format, negative examples, and duplicate group handling.
