## Common Tasks

### Running Extraction on Sample Filings

```bash
# See setup-guide.md for detailed instructions
python scripts/run_extraction_sample.py
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
pytest -v

# Specific module
pytest tests/unit/extraction/test_value_extractor.py -v

# With coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Building the Universe

```bash
# See setup-guide.md for database setup first
python scripts/build_universe_real.py --start-date 2015-01-01 --end-date 2025-12-31
```

### Querying Results

```sql
-- Filing-level incidence by year
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM filing_date) AS year,
    metric_id,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE metric_disclosed_flag) AS disclosed_count,
    COUNT(*) AS total_filings
FROM v_filing_metric_incidence
WHERE is_in_scope_phase1
GROUP BY year, metric_id
ORDER BY year, metric_id;
```

## Key Concepts

### Metrics

Standardized customer-related measurements (e.g., new customers acquired, revenue by cohort). See [Metrics Taxonomy](development/metrics-taxonomy.md).

### Segments

Atomic units of filing content (paragraphs, tables, footnotes) from which metrics are extracted. See [Extraction Pipeline](architecture/extraction-pipeline.md).

### Incidence

Whether a metric is disclosed in a filing (binary: yes/no). See [Analytic Requirements](requirements/analytic-requirements.md).

### Quality Score

0-3 scale assessment of disclosure quality. See [Quality Model](development/quality-model.md).

### Alignment

How closely an issuer's metric definition matches the CMASB canonical definition. See [Quality Model](development/quality-model.md).

### Cohort

Group of customers by acquisition period or tenure. See [Metrics Taxonomy](development/metrics-taxonomy.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Module not found" errors**
- Ensure you're in the project root directory
- Verify virtual environment is activated: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Database connection errors**
- Check `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` file
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running (use Docker: `docker compose up -d`)
- Verify connection: `psql $DATABASE_URL`

**LLM extraction failures**
- Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` file
- Verify API key is valid
- Check rate limits and costs in OpenAI dashboard

**Low extraction quality**
- Review [Quality Model](development/quality-model.md)
- Check QA warnings in database
- Run sample extractions and compare to source

### Getting Help

1. **Check Documentation:** Start with [System Overview](architecture/system-overview.md)
2. **Review Tests:** Look at test files for usage examples
3. **Check Logs:** Review `logs/` directory for error details
4. **Ask the Team:** Contact project maintainers
